# c+-

The language `c+-` is a dialect of `c++` with some minor differences:

- The only available data types are `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool` and `string`.
- There are no pointers, procedures, functions, classes, or objects.
- Arrays can only be declared with a fixed size but it does not need to be constant.
- The precedence of the compound operators `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`, is exactly the same.
