# Code SL/CE

Web interpreter for `c+-`, made with ❤️ to help students understand code.

### c+-

The language `c+-` is a dialect of `c++` with some minor differences:

- Namespaces like `std` are not necessary.
- Simpler execution / compilation errors.
- Dynamic type checking instead of static.
- The only available data types are `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool` and `string`.
- There are no pointers, procedures, functions, classes, exceptions or objects.
- Arrays have a fixed size but it does not need to be constant.
- Precedence of compound operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`) is the same.
- There is no type inference with the `auto` keyword.
